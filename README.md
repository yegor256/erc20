This small Ruby [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/erc20)
makes manipulations with [Ethereum] [ERC20] tokens
as simple as they can be, if you have a provider of
[JSON-RPC] and [WebSockets] Ethereum APIs, for example
[Infura], [GetBlock], or [Alchemy]:

```ruby
# Create a wallet:
require 'erc20'
w = ERC20::Wallet.new(
  contract: ERC20::Wallet.USDT, # hex of it
  host: 'mainnet.infura.io',
  http_path: '/v3/<your-infura-key>',
  ws_path: '/ws/v3/<your-infura-key>',
  log: $stdout
)

# Check how many ERC20 tokens are on the given address:
usdt = w.balance(address)

# Send a few ERC20 tokens to someone and get transaction hash:
hex = w.pay(private_key, to_address, amount)

# Stay waiting, and trigger the block when new ERC20 payments show up:
addresses = ['0x...', '0x...'] # only wait for payments to these addresses
w.accept(addresses) do |event|
  puts event[:txn] # hash of transaction
  puts event[:amount] # how much, in tokens (1000000 = $1 USDT)
  puts event[:from] # who sent the payment
  puts event[:to] # who was the receiver
end
```

It's also possible to check ETH balance and send ETH transaction:

```ruby
# Check how many ETHs are there on the given address:
eth = w.eth_balance(address)

# Send a few ETHs to someone and get transaction hash:
hex = w.eth_pay(private_key, to_address, amount)
```

To check the price of a gas unit and the expected cost of a payment:

```ruby
# How many gas units required to send this payment:
units = w.gas_estimate(from, to, amount)

# What is the price of a gas unit, in gwei:
gwei = w.gas_price
```

To generate a new private key, use [eth](https://rubygems.org/gems/eth):

```ruby
require 'eth'
key = Eth::Key.new.private_hex
```

To convert a private key to a public address:

```ruby
public_hex = Eth::Key.new(priv: key).address
```

To connect to the server via [HTTP proxy] with [basic authentication]:

```ruby
w = ERC20::Wallet.new(
  host: 'go.getblock.io',
  http_path: '/<your-rpc-getblock-key>',
  ws_path: '/<your-ws-getblock-key>',
  proxy: 'http://jeffrey:swordfish@example.com:3128' # here!
)
```

You can use [squid-proxy] [Docker] image to set up your own [HTTP proxy] server.

Of course, this library works with [Polygon], [Optimism],
and other EVM compatible blockchains.

## How to use in command line

This gem also provides a command line tool for sending ETH and ERC20 payments
and checking balances.

First, you install it, via [gem]:

```bash
gem install erc20
```

Then, run it:

```bash
erc20 --help
```

It should be obvious how to use it. If not, please, submit an issue.

## How to use in tests

You can use `ERC20::FakeWallet` class that behaves exactly like
`ERC20::Wallet`, but doesn't make any network connections to the provider.
Also, it remembers all requests that were sent to it:

```ruby
require 'erc20'
w = ERC20::FakeWallet.new
w.pay(priv, address, 42_000)
assert w.history.include?({ method: :pay, priv:, address:, amount: 42_000 })
```

## How to contribute

Read
[these guidelines](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html).
Make sure you build is green before you contribute
your pull request. You will need to have
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) 3.2+ and
[Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed. Then:

```bash
bundle update
bundle exec rake
```

If it's clean and you don't see any error messages, submit your pull request.
